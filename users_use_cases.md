## First maternity, New Mum 0-12 months
* Learning curve
* NCT group / mum groups
* Physical recovery
* Anxiety / stress, lack of confidence
* Social events / coffee meetups → search for a community
* Figuring out routine, building up new knowledge of whats on
* Looking for variety of things to do; choice of PARENT not the child
* Cheap
* DON’T KNOW WHEN TERM TIME IS
* More drop in classes
* Lots of baby nap times - always walking out and about to get child to sleep

## Return to work, older only baby, part-time worker 6 months - 3 years
* Time is precious; doing lots of admin / house stuff
* Probably want to plan in advance (e.g. on a working day)
* Nap times still important
* Want something *good* to do
* Loss of mums group (everyone back at work)
* Regularity of classes and opportunity to meet a new community of mums is helpful
* Child develops preferences


## Second maternity, older child and young baby
* Older child probably in nursery part-time
* Awkward timings - naps & school run
* Baby get lugged around / put down wherever → elder child takes priority when they’re around but looking for classes that are easy with multiple children
* Stay at home more
* More home entertaining / playdates → what to do when a playdate gets cancelled?
* Less knowledge of what’s going on generally → no NCT network
* Likely to pick termly activities / block book for the older child
